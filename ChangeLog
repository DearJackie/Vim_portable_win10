To build the database, follow the steps:
1. Create the file list cscope will build database on: cscope.files
2. Run "cscope -b -q -k" program to create a database for the listed source files, the generated database name
   is "cscope.out":
   -b: create database only, no GUI
   -q: created inverted index file
   -k: 
3. Add the database connection to Vim: ":cs add cscope.out", check the connection status using: ":cs show"
4. Once a scope connection is established, make queries to cscope in Vim: ":cs find <type> <symbol>". This can
   be mapped to shortcut keys("cscope_maps.vim" does this).
5. " Ctrl - T " to go back to previous one.
